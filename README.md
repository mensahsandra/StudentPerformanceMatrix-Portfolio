## About This Project  
This project is part of my journey to become a **cloud engineer**. My goals for this project were to:

* Learn how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration  
* Deploy a static website to the cloud (using Vercel)  
* Understand the basics of cloud hosting and web deployment  

The site features a simple login page and a student dashboard, simulating a real-world educational tool.

## üí° Motivation  
I built this project as part of my learning journey into cloud and web technologies. Though it's a simple UI project, it reflects my:

* Passion for tech and cloud development  
* Interest in building user-focused tools  
* Ongoing commitment to grow and improve as a developer  

## Future Plans  
I plan to improve this project by:

* Adding real-time data features (e.g., Firebase or Supabase)  
* Deploying via GitHub Actions or cloud CI/CD workflows  
* Exploring integration with cloud databases  

## Tech Stack

* HTML5  
* CSS3  
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (Cloud Hosting)  
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) (Version Control)

## Skills Demonstrated

* Cloud deployment using Vercel  
* Version control using Git & GitHub  
* Static web development (HTML & CSS)  
* Project documentation using README best practices
