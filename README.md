## About This Project

I created this project as part of my journey to become a cloud engineer. My goal was to learn how to:
- Use GitHub for version control
- Deploy a static website to the cloud (using Vercel)
- Understand the basics of cloud hosting and web deployment

## Why Cloud Engineering?

I am passionate about technology and eager to learn more about cloud computing. This project is my first step, and I am excited to keep building my skills!
